# Subway_Route_Finder
A 5 person Java project which focused on decoupling. It takes in a file detailing subway stops and paths between them and uses uniform cost search to find the quickest path.

We used the boston subway map as the test case for our program due to the wide range of routes, intersections and vast amount of stops.
